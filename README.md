# Staballoy
Reactive UI improvement for Titanium with event handling

Why the name staballoy? Well.. to quote wikipedia

> staballoys are metal alloys of a high proportion of depleted uranium with other metals, usually titanium

It has the Titanium in it, is an alloy and uranium is a reactive metal. Sounds like the perfect name to me.
